# Smart Contract Security Testing with Hardhat

This repository demonstrates the process of securing smart contracts using Hardhat. The project focuses on testing, identifying vulnerabilities, and securing DeFi contracts. Step-by-step documentation and findings are provided for each phase.

## Project Overview
This project was created to explore smart contract security practices using the Hardhat framework. It includes contract development, testing for vulnerabilities, and the implementation of best practices to ensure secure deployment.

## Folder Structure
- **contracts/**: Contains the smart contract code.
- **test/**: Contains the unit tests for the contracts.
- **scripts/**: Contains deployment scripts.
- **hardhat.config.js**: Configuration file for Hardhat.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-contract-security-hardhat.git
   cd smart-contract-security-hardhat
2. Install dependencies:
- npm install

3.Compile the smart contract:
- npx hardhat compile


### Step 4: Add the Project Step-by-Step
Let’s break this down into manageable steps and add them gradually:

1. **Set up Hardhat**:
   - Install Hardhat and initialize the project.
   - Configure the basic files (`hardhat.config.js`).
   
2. **Create the Smart Contract**:
   - Create a sample smart contract to test (e.g., a basic ERC20 token or DeFi contract).
   - Add a simple vulnerability (e.g., reentrancy attack or unprotected function).

3. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Add tests for common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflow/underflow, access control, etc.

4. **Security Audit & Remediation**:
   - Run Hardhat's testing framework to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Document how you identified and fixed vulnerabilities.
   
5. **Final Documentation**:
   - Document the entire process, including findings and mitigation strategies.

### Step 5: Execute the Plan

Let’s start by **setting up Hardhat** and creating a basic smart contract. Would you like to proceed with that? I can provide the commands and code to set everything up.
